We've recently decided to replace the existing database implementation in Vindigo with SurrealDB. While doing so, we developed a need for a query explorer for SurrealDB but discovered that no one had created one yet.
So, we decided to create a simple but effective Desktop client called Surrealist which is useful for creating, testing, and exploring SurrealDB queries.

Surrealist already supports multi-tab editing, batched queries, syntax highlighting and more. Feel free to use it if you're also interested in using SurrealDB for your own projects! You can find the source code as well as Windows and OSX downloads on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/Surrealist). 
If you enjoy using Surrealist, please consider starring the repository on GitHub, and if you like, consider [donating to our PayPal](https://paypal.me/StarlaneStudios) to support the development of this project and others. 

We hope you find it as useful as we do!
