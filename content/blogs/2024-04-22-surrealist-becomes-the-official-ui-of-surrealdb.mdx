# Introduction
If you read our [Starlane Studios Year End Review 2023](https://starlane.studio/blog/starlane-studios-year-end-review-2023) blog post from December, you might recall that we alluded to a "huge announcement" regarding Surrealist which was coming in Q2 of this year. Well, this is that announcement. 

After 16 months of hard work building and growing Surrealist, I am pleased to announce that I have officially joined the SurrealDB team full time and that Surrealist is now the official graphical interface of SurrealDB! (See the announcement trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0_lj-ILVhE)) To learn more about how we got to this point, be sure to check out this [blog post](https://surrealdb.com/blog/the-surrealist-journey) on the SurrealDB website.

# Introducing Surrealist 2.0
With the announcement of Surrealist becoming the official UI of SurrealDB on the horizon, it felt like a great time to clean up and overhaul a lot of the legacy code which has been left around since the early days. Some of these changes include: simplification of managing connections, merging live query support into the Query View, as well as updating the SurrealQL editor. Version 2.0 also features an array of new features such as: an easy-to-navigate command palette, an API docs viewer for viewing personalized documentation, and much much more. To view a full list of changes associated with the v2.0 release, check out the full changelog [here](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealist/releases/tag/surrealist-v2.0.0).

# Starlane Studios 2.0 Starts Now
Along with Surrealist 2.0 and this announcement that Surrealist has become the official UI of SurrealDB comes the beginning of Starlane Studios 2.0. As mentioned in our end of year 2023 blog post in December, our goal at Starlane Studios has always been to make games. For too long we have left this goal of ours on the backburner, focusing primarily on our open source projects. With Surrealist now leaving Starlane Studios and becoming a product of SurrealDB, this now allows us to fully focus our free time on our core mission to bring you high quality games made by gamers, for gamers. We have already started the process of making our first real game and are making big strides. More information on this game is to come at a later date which is closer to its release.

# Closing Remarks
I am incredibly happy to be at SurrealDB full time in a position where I can dedicate my time to Surrealist and break through new frontiers in order to make Surrealist the ultimate dashboard for the ultimate database. I would like to thank everyone who has used and supported Surrealist as well those who made it possible such as our GitHub contributors and those at Starlane Studios who have assisted in ways both big and small. Here's to many more great months for Surrealist to come ðŸ¥‚
