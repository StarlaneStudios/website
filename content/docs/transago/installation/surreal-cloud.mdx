# SurrealDB Cloud Setup
This step of the guide assumes you have no knowledge of SurrealDB or SurrealDB cloud. On this page, you will find information on setting up a SurrealDB Cloud instance from scratch.


## Step 1: Navigate to the SurrealDB Cloud Page
Navigate to the SurrealDB Cloud page by clicking [here](https://surrealist.app/referral?code=3osfm8svd71jmp56). Please note that this link is a referral link and that Starlane Studios or one of its members may receive a referral reward if you signup using this link. You may also receive <b>$25 in free credits</b> by using our referral link to signup.

## Step 2: Sign Up to SurrealDB Cloud
Once you reach the SurrealDB Cloud home page, click on the continue button. Then, click on register at the bottom of the page. You may sign up with any existing account you wish, or by email.

## Step 3: Create an Instance

### Return to SurrealDB Cloud
Once you have created your SurrealDB Cloud account, return to the SurrealDB cloud page. You should automatically be redirected to the cloud instances page where you will be prompted to create your first instance. 

### Begin Creating
Click on the Create Instance button. You may name this instance whatever you like. This name will not be seen by anyone but yourself. You should leave the SurrealDB Version on the latest version, which will be automatically placed in the box for you. Then, click on continue. 

### Choose a Region
From here, you will be asked to select a server region. Choose whichever region is the closest to you and then click continue.

### Selecting a Category
You will now be prompted to select the category of your instance. For most users, the Free Instance option is the best because it is free and has enough memory, compute, and storage for most. If you plan on using Transago in a professional setting or require more resources, it is recommended to use Production. It should be noted, however, that any selections in this category will cost money to use and are not free. 

### Selecting an Instance Type (Paid Only)
If you chose to use a production instance in the last step, you will now be asked to enter your billing information and select an instance type. The type that you pick here is up to you, your use case, and how many users you expect to have. For most, it makes the most sense to go with the medium preset.

## Step 4: Connect to Your Instance
Now that you have successfully created your SurrealDB Cloud instance you should connect to it. To do so, click on the connect button and then select Open in Surrealist. This option should be at the top of the menu.

## Finished!
You have now setup and connected to your SurrealDB Cloud instance and are ready to proceed to the next step, which involves configuring your SurrealDB instance for Transago.
