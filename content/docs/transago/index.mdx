# Getting Started

# What is Transago

Transago is a simple and easy to use bill tracking app which allows you to keep track of all bills and their associated payments.

## Important Notes
<b>⚠️ Transago is in early development and should not be used in production! ⚠️</b><br/>
<br/>

These docs are not complete and will change as the project evolves and releases. 
The instructions provided in this guide right now demonstrate methods which we have deemed as too complex and will be simplified significantly before the initial beta release. 

## Features
- 🕔 See what bills are due soon or are overdue
- 🔖 Save the links, phone numbers, or mailing addresses for your bills in one place
- 💵 Log your payments and keep track of your monthly expenses
- ➕ More features coming very soon!
